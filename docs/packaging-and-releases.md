# Packaging, Versioning, Tagging, Releases

This repo publishes multiple artifacts (crates.io, PyPI, npm) from one monorepo. The goal is:

- **A single “product surface” version** shared across Rust (`crates/formualizer`), PyPI, and npm.
- **Independent release tracks** for the high-performance parser + shared types, and for the SheetPort spec.
- **Repeatable automation**: tags drive publishing; workflows fail fast if versions don’t match.

## What We Publish

### Rust (crates.io)

**SDK / parser track**
- `formualizer-common`: shared value/address/reference types.
- `formualizer-parse`: tokenizer/parser/pretty-print.

**Product track**
- `formualizer-eval`: evaluation engine.
- `formualizer-workbook`: workbook abstraction + loaders.
- `formualizer-sheetport`: SheetPort runtime over a workbook.
- `formualizer`: roll-up (“product surface”) crate; intended primary interface for bindings and most downstreams.

**Spec track**
- `sheetport-spec`: YAML/JSON schema + validation + CLI.

### Python (PyPI)

- `formualizer` (maturin / pyo3 extension): the product surface for Python.
  - Published wheels: manylinux (x86_64, aarch64), musllinux (x86_64, aarch64), macOS (x86_64, arm64), Windows (x64), and **Pyodide** (`pyodide_<abi>_wasm32`) — all under the same PyPI project and version.
  - End users install identically on every target: `pip install formualizer` on native, `await micropip.install("formualizer")` in a Pyodide runtime.

### JS/WASM (npm)

- `formualizer` (wasm-pack output + TypeScript wrapper): the product surface for JS.

## Version Tracks

### 1) Product surface track (shared across Rust + PyPI + npm)

**Rule:** The following versions are always identical:

- `crates/formualizer/Cargo.toml` (`package.version`)
- `bindings/python/pyproject.toml` (`project.version`)
- `bindings/wasm/package.json` (`version`)

This is the public “Formualizer product version”.

### 2) Parser/SDK track (`formualizer-common` + `formualizer-parse`)

**Rule:** `formualizer-common` and `formualizer-parse` share one version and can ship independently of the product surface.

This allows the parser to evolve (and be consumed directly) without forcing a product/bindings release.

### 3) Spec track (`sheetport-spec`)

**Rule:** `sheetport-spec` is versioned and tagged independently.

Product releases may depend on a `sheetport-spec` version; if the product needs a newer spec, publish the spec first.

## Tagging Scheme

Tags encode *which track* is being released.

- **Product release:** `vX.Y.Z`
  - publishes: Rust product crates + PyPI + npm
- **Parser/SDK release:** `parse-vX.Y.Z`
  - publishes: `formualizer-common`, `formualizer-parse`
- **Spec release:** `sheetport-spec-vX.Y.Z`
  - publishes: `sheetport-spec` (and triggers mirror)

Multiple tags can point at the same commit if we want “synced” releases without forcing a single global version.

## Dependency + Pinning Rules

### Rust workspace dependencies

- Use workspace deps for internal development (`path = ...`).
- Published crates must also specify a **version requirement** for internal deps.

### Cross-track compatibility

- Product crates should depend on parser/SDK crates with semver ranges (not exact pins) once `parse/common` reach stability.
  - Current 3.0 track: product crates depend on `formualizer-parse = "^3.0"` and `formualizer-common = "^3.0"`.
- While `0.x`, treat “minor” bumps as breaking; avoid frequent cross-track churn.

### Feature forwarding

`crates/formualizer` is the binding-facing surface. To let bindings depend only on `formualizer`, it must forward required features:

- Workbook backends (`calamine`, `umya`, `json`, etc.)
- Optional engine behavior toggles
- SheetPort integration toggles

Bindings should enable features on `formualizer` (not on individual subcrates).

## Release package preflight

Run the credential-free package preflight from a clean release commit **before creating a tag**:

```bash
python3 scripts/release-preflight.py --track parse
python3 scripts/release-preflight.py --track spec
python3 scripts/release-preflight.py --track product
```

Use only the track being released. `--allow-dirty` exists for development checks and is forbidden for a release tag.

Every track first asserts the parser/SDK lockstep rule: `formualizer-common` and `formualizer-parse` must carry the same manifest version, and the product track additionally requires that version to already exist on crates.io. A product release that pins an unpublished parser-track version fails here rather than at `cargo publish`.

For multi-crate tracks, the script packages crates in dependency order, adds each prospective archive to a temporary local Cargo registry, and verifies downstream archives against those exact bytes. Workspace path dependencies therefore cannot hide an unpublished or incompatible registry package. The staging registry and Cargo home are temporary; inherited Cargo/GitHub token variables are removed and Git prompting is disabled. The exact `cargo-local-registry` helper and its isolated download cache live under `target/release-preflight-*` without replacing a global tool.

For every package, the preflight queries crates.io. A version that does not yet exist is accepted. If the version exists, the shipped source/data/doc payload must match exactly; generated `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, and `.cargo_vcs_info.json` are excluded because they vary with Cargo or the source commit, while `Cargo.toml.orig` remains compared so dependency requirements are covered. Any other difference means the source must be restored or the package version bumped.

The tag-triggered release workflow repeats the same preflight before any publish job receives a registry token. The pre-tag run avoids creating a bad tag; the workflow run prevents publication if a tag bypasses the human checklist.

## Publishing Order (Rust)

### Parser/SDK release (`parse-v*`)

1. `formualizer-common`
2. `formualizer-parse`

### Spec release (`sheetport-spec-v*`)

1. `sheetport-spec`

### Product release (`v*`)

Precondition: required `sheetport-spec` version already published.

Publish in dependency order:

1. `formualizer-macros` (if required by eval)
2. `formualizer-eval`
3. `formualizer-workbook`
4. `formualizer-sheetport`
5. `formualizer` (roll-up)

## GitHub Actions Release Principles

Release workflows should:

- Trigger on the correct tag pattern.
- Verify tag ↔ manifest version matches for that track.
- Run a `cargo publish --dry-run` (or equivalent check) before publishing.
- Publish without masking failures (no `|| true`).

For npm builds, ensure the wasm-pack target matches what we publish (bundler vs web target) and that the generated `pkg/` content matches what `package.json` expects.

## Pyodide wheel pipeline

The Pyodide wheel is built by `bindings/python/scripts/build-pyodide-wheel.sh` on every PR (`ci.yml :: build-pyodide-wheel`) and on every product release tag (`release.yml :: build-wheels-pyodide`), then uploaded to PyPI by `publish-pypi` alongside the platform wheels.

Key pipeline specifics worth knowing before touching this path:

- **Pyodide version target is derived, not hardcoded.** The build script reads `pyodide xbuildenv version`, `python_version`, `emscripten_version`, `rust_toolchain`, `rustflags`, `cflags`, `cxxflags`, `ldflags`, and `rust_emscripten_target_url` from `pyodide config`. Bumping `pyodide-build` changes the target; everything else follows.
- **Custom Rust sysroot is mandatory.** Stock `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-emscripten` ships a `std` built with JS-trampoline exceptions (`invoke_*`), which Pyodide 0.29+ rejects with a dynamic-linking error at import time. The build script downloads Pyodide's prebuilt wasm-EH sysroot (`rust-emscripten-wasm-eh-sysroot` on GitHub) and extracts it over rustup's stock target. A sentinel file in the target dir makes this idempotent across runs.
- **Wheel is retagged after build.** `pyodide-build 0.34` repacks wheels with `pyemscripten_2025_0_wasm32`, which the `micropip` shipped in Pyodide 0.29.x misparses as an Emscripten version string and rejects. The build script retags to `pyodide_2025_0_wasm32` (the tag Pyodide's own package lockfile uses), so `micropip.install` accepts the wheel without falling back to zip extraction.
- **Smoke gate is mandatory.** Both CI and release jobs run `smoke-pyodide-wheel.sh`, which loads the wheel into a real Pyodide runtime and exercises parse, evaluate, byte I/O, and Python UDF paths. A broken wheel never reaches PyPI.
- **Supported-Pyodide range is implicit in `pyodide-build` pin.** `pyodide-build 0.34.x` targets Pyodide 0.29.x (ABI `pyodide_2025_0`). When Pyodide cuts a new ABI, bump `pyodide-build` (and re-verify the sysroot URL in `pyodide config get rust_emscripten_target_url` still resolves), then cut a formualizer release. Document the supported Pyodide range in `bindings/python/README.md`.

## Version Bump Script

Use `scripts/bump-version.py` to update versions across all manifests for a given track:

```bash
# Product track (Rust product crates + Python + npm)
./scripts/bump-version.py --track product --version 0.4.0

# Parser/SDK track (formualizer-common + formualizer-parse)
./scripts/bump-version.py --track parse --version 3.0.0

# Spec track (sheetport-spec package + downstream adoption floor)
./scripts/bump-version.py --track spec --version 0.3.1

# Preview changes without modifying files
./scripts/bump-version.py --track product --version 0.4.0 --dry-run

# Skip cargo check verification
./scripts/bump-version.py --track product --version 0.4.0 --no-verify
```

The script updates:
- **Package versions** in `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`
- **Workspace dependencies** in root `Cargo.toml`
- **Internal dependency versions** (e.g., `formualizer-eval = { path = "...", version = "X.Y.Z" }`)
- **Spec adoption floors** in `formualizer-sheetport` and the roll-up crate when the spec track changes, preventing packaged crates from resolving behavior older than the local path source

After bumping, the script runs `cargo check` to verify the workspace compiles (use `--no-verify` to skip).

## Release Checklist (human)

1. Decide which track(s) you are releasing.
2. Run `./scripts/bump-version.py --track <track> --version <version>` (use `--dry-run` first to preview).
3. Ensure `CHANGELOG` entries exist where applicable.
4. Commit the version bump: `git commit -am "chore: bump <track> to <version>"`.
5. From the clean commit, run `python3 scripts/release-preflight.py --track <track>` and retain the package hashes in the release evidence.
6. Create the tag: `git tag v<version>` (or `parse-v<version>` / `sheetport-spec-v<version>`).
7. Push the branch and tag.
8. Verify the tag workflow repeats the preflight and publishes successfully.
